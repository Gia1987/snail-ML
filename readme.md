# SNAIL üêå

## Introduction

SNAIL is a team project conducted by four software developers interested in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.The MVP of this project consists on: 

"Creating a self-driven car which uses ML for it to take the best decisions (turning right, turning left, drive straight).
The soution will be implemented on a small scale car that will drive itself through a random circuit.
Given a random circuit, we assume that the car keeps a constant speed and that it will face X-degree turns."

SNAIL constitues our Final Project for the Makers Academy Bootcamp. After brainstorming and diagriminh, the MVP was delivered in just 7 days. As software develpers who experienced the same Academy, we all have an inclination to follow Agile principles, Test Driven Development and best practices for Code Quality.

As a team, our areas or focus are:
- Learning process.
- Code writing.
- Team work and use of Agile methodologies.

run the following command on the shell to have python linter available:
```bash
pip install pylint
```
in order to analyse the code quality of a file, do so as in this example:
```bash
pylint path_helper_main_ml.py
```
run the following command on the shell to update your environment after cloning the repository:
```bash
pip3 install requirements
```
run the following command on the shell to check the test coverage:
```bash
py.test --cov test/
```
